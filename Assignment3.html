            <h1>Final Impressions</h1>
            <p>The Banned Book Club was definitely an interesting book. One
                thing that especially stood out to me was the fact that it was
                written as sort of a biography or a recollection of an event
                that occurred to the author (Hyun Sook), but not only that but
                the fact that it was also done in a graphic novel format. Which
                I have personally not seen. I feel that the way that this story
                was written was really good. In a graphic novel format, you can
                reach many more people than you would have been able to if you
                had stuck to the traditional novel style. Graphic novels break
                down the events in a much simpler way. This means that both
                young and old audiences alike can enjoy it. In a graphic novel,
                there aren’t many words that are needed because a lot of what
                takes up the word count is describing, people, places, and
                actions. In a graphic novel, these things are illustrated
                rendering words unnecessary. Which allows you to now focus on
                the dialect and the words that are spoken between characters.
                You can also see more context in what is happening in any given
                interaction because you can see facial expressions. When you try
                to describe these things in writing you always run the risk of
                not portraying what you really mean, when it’s illustrated the
                reader can see exactly what you meant.
            </p>
            <p>I would say that the character development of Hyun Sook herself
                was very good. Of course, I would expect her to be the best
                since this is her story, and it is mostly from her point of
                view. I feel that the way her character was developed was
                visible but not too obvious, which was very nice. At the
                beginning of the book, she was a shy and timid person who wanted
                to completely avoid politics. However, as she is immersed in
                “college life” more and more she starts becoming braver and
                louder about her beliefs. She also starts getting more and more
                political, especially once introduced to certain facts that
                showed the corruption of the government. At the end of the book,
                she is a full participant in the protests and is no longer
                afraid to spread her beliefs. I feel that some of the other main
                characters (the other members of book club) could have benefited
                from showing their character growth more like Gundo and Suji.
                I’m sure that during this time both Gundo and Suji grew as
                people, it just wasn’t highlighted in the book as much as some
                of the other characters.
            </p>
            <p>As I talked about in the first assignment, I believe that the
                main themes of the book are governmental censorship, oppression,
                and finding the truth even when it’s hidden. I believe that the
                authors did a great job of portraying these themes. I believe
                that the main purpose of this book was to raise awareness about
                the many places where people are still oppressed, and the truth
                is actively hidden from them just like they were in South Korea.
                It tells people how to oppose the forces that keep them down. If
                this was the purpose of this book, I believe it was successful.
            </p>
            <p>I personally enjoyed this book. I think it was a nice book that
                was kind of a nice breather from some of the other more
                confusing books that we have covered this year. It had a good
                message, and it had a good plot. I would recommend this book to
                others as I feel that it is a good book to read. I feel that it
                taught me a lot of things I didn’t know about the history of
                South Korea. Before this, I personally thought that South Korea
                didn’t really have many problems, since it was kind of
                overshadowed by how horrible North Korea is. I feel that I
                learned much about the history and culture of South Korea, and I
                know that it can help others understand South Korea better as
                well. I rate this book as a 7. It was a good book, but it’s
                obviously not the best book I have ever read in my life.
