            <h1>Part 1:</h1>
            <h2>Guiding Questions for Beginning of Book. (Pages: 1-68) </h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the book, the setting is Hyun Sook’s parent’s
                steak place in the city. Later in the beginning it also mentions
                that this is the only steak restaurant in her city. This city is
                located in South Korea. During the 1980s South Korea was under a
                repressive and brutal dictatorship. Another place that was
                included in the first part of the book was Anjeon University
                which is the college that Hyun Sook is going to for her studies.
                There are other smaller locations such as Suji’s apartment which
                is where the banned book club takes place in the first part of
                the book. Other places mentioned are the bookstore where Hyun
                Sook picks up a banned book and the cafeteria where they watch
                the German newscasting.
            </p>
            <p>I would say that one of the major events in the book is at the
                very beginning of the book. At the beginning of the book Hyun
                Sook is having a conversation with her mother. I feel that this
                really gives us a lot of information and sets the tone for the
                rest of the book. In this conversation, Hyun Sook’s mother
                mentions that all that happens on campuses is protests. Which
                then becomes an integral part of the remainder of the story.
            </p>
            <p>I feel that this conversation also spreads more light on the
                culture in South Korea at the time, especially surrounding the
                issues of women and how they were viewed by society. It mentions
                that Hyun Sook’s mother is more traditional, we can see that
                when she says “I told you if you think college is so important
                why not get a job and save money so your brother can go?” It is
                also revealed to us in this conversation that her mother might
                be hiding some jealousy because she wasn’t even allowed to go to
                High School and instead had to take care of her siblings. This
                compares to old American culture as well. In the 1950s women
                were viewed in much the same way. That way is that they didn’t
                really need to be educated and their primary job was to get
                married and have kids and take care of their husbands. It is
                very similar to that just at a later time period.
            </p>

        <div class="assignOnePartTwo">
            <h1>Part 2:</h1>
            <h2>Guiding Questions for the Middle of Book. (Pages: 69-134)</h2>
            <p>In the middle of the book, many things happen. One major conflict
                that occurs during the middle of the book is Jihoo getting
                arrested. This occurrence really caused a lot of internal
                struggles for the group. It caused Hoon to “disband” the group
                because he didn’t want people to be in more danger than they
                already were. In stories, there always seems to be this point
                where the main characters are at odds with each other or seem to
                have given up hope that their cause is important enough to
                continue. I feel that this moment is the time when this happens
                in the plot. I would classify this as an internal struggle among
                the group. Where we see Jihoo in jail in a compromising
                situation, Hoon wants to disband the group, Gundo wants to trade
                himself for Jihoo potentially having more members of the club
                captured, and Suji and Yuni are together in keeping the club
                together although Suji got thrown out of her mom’s house. This
                leaves Hyun Sook in the middle of it all.
            </p>
            <p>The banned book club is written in a third-person view. Meaning
                that we are seeing it as though we ourselves were there but
                invisible only to observe what happens. In this book, we mostly
                follow the main character, Hyun Sook. However, there are times
                when we switch perspectives to other people. For instance, when
                Jihoo is being interrogated by Agent Ok, we are witnessing that
                even though Hyun Sook is not there at that time. I think that
                the third-person is a good perspective to choose for this kind
                of book. It gives more flexibility on what we can witness and
                whom we are viewing. Typically, in a first-person perspective,
                you would only see the perspective of the main character or
                characters. In the third-person, you can be wherever the story
                needs you to be. So overall I think it is a good choice for this
                book.
            </p>
            <p>A quote that I found significant to this part of the story was
                “everyone has a right to the truth.” This line is said by Yuni
                while telling a brief version of why she started the book club,
                whilst being pestered about not sharing the real story of why
                she herself thought it was a good idea to start the club.
                However, I do feel like this states the mission of the book club
                in a simple way. The purpose of the book club is to spread the
                truth that everyone is entitled to. I feel that in the book we
                kind of infer the purpose of the book club, however, now we have
                confirmation of what the purpose of this club is. This is why I
                think it is important to the story.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="assignOnePartThree">
            <h1>Part 3:</h1>
            <h2>Guiding Questions for the End of Book. (Pages: 135-200)</h2>
            <p>I would say that the main themes of the book were governmental
                censorship and oppression and finding the truth even when it is
                hidden. It is expressed throughout the book that South Korea at
                this time is an oppressed country. We can see this because there
                is the police force that is brutally interrogating people for
                anything that they deem is related to communism. Many books and
                publications are banned and the penalty for carrying one of
                these items is severe. That brings us to the second theme set of
                the book. Our main characters in the book are directly opposing
                the South Korean government at this time, which as mentioned
                before is a crime with harsh consequences. They do it in the
                hope that the government gets reformed, and that the truth can
                be spread instead of censored and hidden from the public. As
                this is a true story it fits in with the timeline because we do
                know that South Korea was under authoritarian rule in the 1980s.
                It fits in with the rest of the world because there are still
                many places that are like South Korea in the 1980s such as North
                Korea, which is arguably worse than South Korea ever was.
            </p>
            <p>I believe that the climax of the book is near the end when they
                are protesting for the release of Jihoo. To me, this seems like
                the last major conflict that occurs and also the biggest
                conflict that occurs during the book. I think it kind of reached
                this point because of several things. I think the biggest factor
                was most likely the arrest of Jihoo and the publication of the
                illegal newspaper that Hoon published about Jihoo’s arrest. I
                feel that this is the moment where Hyun Sook finally and fully
                joins the fight against the oppressive regime. Before we see
                that she is often hesitant to defy the authorities. I also think
                we see the last of her hesitance leaving when she confronts a
                student about reporting the illegal newspaper to the authorities
                where we see her say this line, “If you want to walk up to those
                men with guns and wave blacklisted material, you be my guest.
                But you’d better be sure you’re right about who the good guys
                are.” After this moment the rest of the story winds down and we
                see the aftermath of what happened to each of the main
                characters 33 years later.
            </p>
            <p>I learned a lot of things from this book. I was not very familiar
                with the history of South Korea during this time period. I
                always thought that South Korea had been a free state and that
                North Korea was the one with all the problems. I mostly thought
                this because North Korea is more known for its authoritarian
                government style and also because South Korea is currently free.
                I also got to learn more about South Korean culture. Overall,
                this book was a fun read and taught me a lot about a country
                that I wasn’t overtly familiar with.
