            <h2>Character Inteview ~ W/ Jihoo</h2>
            <p id="questions">For this section, I choose to have an interview with Jihoo as he
                is one of the main characters, and to me he has the most
                interesting story since he was in prison.</p>
            <p>Q: <b>What did you get sent to prison for?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: I was arrested for being at a protest. I wasn’t
                actually at
                that protest. I didn’t like attending the protests as I am a
                pacifist. They were going to let me go but they discovered a
                book that I was reading from North Korea, which meant it was
                banned.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>How long would you say that you spent in prison?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: Well, I was arrested in 83, and released in
                1992 when Kim
                Young Sam was elected to office and pardoned all of the
                protestors. So that was about 9 years.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>9 years, that’s a lot. How did you spend your time in
                    prison?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: Well, there wasn’t much to do in there, I
                mostly wrote poetry
                and talked to other protestors.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>What were conditions like in the prison?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: They were pretty bad. Cramped Cells, poor food,
                and the guards were very abusive.</p>
            <p>Q: <b>What would happen if you broke the rules?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: The most common thing that would happen is that
                you would get beaten pretty badly. Sometimes you would get
                chained to the wall in an isolated unit and sleep-deprived for a
                couple of days. Most of the time we didn’t get food while we
                were there either.
            </p>
            <p>Q: Did prisoners that received severe injuries get medical
                attention?<b></b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: If it was serious enough, they would get some
                medical treatment, but it wasn’t a lot. There were more than a
                few deaths in the prison. For minor injuries, medical aid was
                not given.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>Were there any nice prison officials?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: There weren’t many but a couple of them would
                turn a blind eye if they saw something that was against prison
                rules.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>Were there any bad inmates?</b></p>
            <p id="questions">A: For the most part not. There was the occasional
                police informant snuck in. Most of the people though were in
                there for the same reason as I was, because the government
                wanted to silence us. That gave us a common purpose and goal.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>We heard that you were in charge of organizing prison
                    strikes and riots. Were those ever traced back to you?</b>
            </p>
            <p id="questions">A: They never did find out that I was the one
                organizing them, the other inmates never told anything to the
                guards. We had to be careful though since the police spies
                within the inmates might have gotten word of it.
            </p>
            <p>Q: <b>What have you done now that you have been released from
                    jail?</b></p>
            <p>A: I published most of the work that I did while
                in prison. I also fight for prison reform now that I’m out I
                don’t want anyone to be in the same situation that I was.

            <p>The Scene I choose to sketch was when Gundo was standing in the
                street protesting alone for Jihoo's release. I felt like drawing
                this one because I feel like this is a big part of the book and
                because I also liked the background. (To see the original slide

            </ol>
            <p id="questions">Summary: In the beginning of the book the action
                and suspense
                aren't going to be as big so I ranked the first to as middle.
                There wasn't any other perspectives in this chapter so that got
                a 1. However, it being the beginning of the book there was loads
                of new information so that gets a 10.</p>
            <h2><b>Chapter 2: 24/50</b></h2>

            </ol>
            <p id="questions">Summary: In this part, I put the beginning action
                and end
                suspense in the middle at 5 that’s because they both showed some
                of the elements for these but they weren't as present as they
                could be. There weren’t a lot of other perspectives but there
                were more than in the last chapter giving it a 3 instead of a 1.
                Finally, there wasn't as much new information to drive the plot
                forward as we are still kind of introducing the character so I
                gave it a 5 right in the middle.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Chapter 3: 26/50</b></h2>

                <li><b>5</b></li>
            </ol>
            <p id="questions">Summary: At the beginning of this chapter they are
                only sitting in class talking so I gave the action a 3 since not
                much was happening. However, at the end of this chapter, it ends
                in Hoon missing which is pretty suspenseful so it gets a 9. Like
                the last chapter, there weren't many other perspectives so I
                gave it a 4. Also, like the last chapter, there wasn't much new
                information to drive the plot besides Hoon's disappearance so it
                gets a 5. </p>

            </ol>
            <p id="questions">Summary: This chapter really starts out with a lot
                of action picking up from the end of the last chapter showing
                Hoon getting interrogated. This chapter also ends with a lot of
                suspense with the police kicking down the door to the cafeteria
                where they are watching banned materials, and barely making it
                out, but leaving others behind in the process. It also advances
                the plot forward a lot so I gave that an 8. Finally, there were
                a lot more perspectives especially since the beginning we start
                at Hoon's perspective. At this point, this is the most exciting
                chapter in the book.

            <p id="questions">Summary: This chapter doesn't start as
                action-filled as the last one but some action is thrown in there
                when the police censor walks into the room to look through the
                paper. This chapter also ends with some suspense with them
                having to sleep in the park and have us wonder what the next
                chapter will bring. There are some other perspectives in this
                but not as many as last time so it gets a 6. Finally, I feel
                that it brings us a lot of new information to use that helps
                move the plot along.

            <p id="questions">Summary: This chapter starts with Hyun Sook going
                to the student council to help make Molotov cocktails which is
                fun but not together action filled so I gave it a 6. The end,
                however, is very suspenseful with the arrest of Jihoo and his
                almost being released. so that gets a 10. We are also switching
                between several perspectives in this chapter which I gave a 10.
                Finally, there was some information in this chapter so I gave it
                a 7. This was a pretty good chapter and very long too.

            <p id="questions">Summary: Compared to the way the last chapter
                ended the start of this chapter doesn't really continue the
                momentum of action that the end of the last chapter had so it
                gets a 6. However, the end of the book ends with the turmoil in
                the book club, and uncertainty about the future was very
                suspenseful so I gave it an 8. As for other perspectives we see
                some perspective of a snitch with Agent Ok so I gave it a
                perspective score of 7. Finally, there wasn't as much
                information as I expected so I gave that a 5.

            <p id="questions">Summary: This chapter started slow with not a lot
                of action happening so I gave it a 6. It didn't really have that
                much suspense but it did end with a nice heartfelt moment with
                Hyun Sook's parents, so I gave it a 7. I would say that it
                didn't stray very much from Hyun Sook's perspective so I gave it
                a three. However, we did get a lot of information, especially
                from Hyun Sook's dad that answers some questions about her
                backstory which helps advance the plot so I gave that an 8.

            <p id="questions">Summary: This chapter starts with some action as
                Hoon gets riled up about Jihoo's arrest and also confronts the
                police snitch. Also, the end is suspenseful and full of action
                with the riot. This leaves us with the suspense of what happened
                to them so I gave this a 10. There were also a lot of different
                perspectives on this from Hoon to Yuni. Finally, as this is the
                climax I feel like we receive a lot of information from a lot of
                places that push the story progression. As this was the climax
                of the story this was the best chapter in the book.

            <p>Summary: As we start with another riot 33 years in
                the future I would say that it starts pretty action-packed, I
                gave it a 10. As it's the end of the book there isn't supposed
                to be much suspense (especially because we aren't expecting a
                sequel), I gave it a 5. There is a little bit of perspective
                change at the beginning with Hoon so I give that a 6. Finally, I
                feel that we received a lot of information that we were looking
                for in the last chapter about what happened to everyone. It also
                gives us all the information about what happened in the 33 years
                that we skipped so I give it a 9.
